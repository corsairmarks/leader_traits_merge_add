[h1]Overview[/h1]
With Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra" it is now possible to enable traits like Cybernetic and Psionic to be applied to your Pops via gene-modding!  Beginning in version 3.2 "Herbert," Stellaris disallows these traits from being merged onto subspecies which don't already have them, which put a damper on creating super species that melded mind, machine, and science.  This mod revives that gameplay - gene-mod away!

[h1]Changes[/h1]
The Cybernetic, Latent Psionic, and Psionic species traits can be merge-added from one species template to another of the same overall species.  Latent Psionic was a little tricky as an "upgradeable" trait - it can be merge-removed if and only if the empire performing the gene-mod has Pops of the same species who have the Psionic trait.  Technically that means [i]any[/i] template can then merge-remove Latent Psionic and not only templates with Psionic, but this is a pretty small caveat.

This mod also adds some extra tweaks:
[list]
[*]Empires with Engineered Evolution can remove Cybernetic from any species templates (mostly for role-play reasons)
[*]Empires with Synthetic Evolution that have completed the corresponding special project can add Cybernetic to any biological or lithoid species templates (thus providing an alternative to full assimilation into synthetics)
[*]Empires who have finished the Brain Slug quest chain can add that trait to any species templates, as long as they aren't xenophobes
[*]Empires who complete the Enigmatic Cache quest chain successfully or partially successfully can add the corresponding traits to some species templates
[list]
[*]Any species that is the "same" as a species which already has the trait
[*]Don't accidentally gene-mod away your last pop with the special trait, or you will lose access - your scientists need examples to study in order to apply the same changes
[/list]
[*]Empires who complete the Alien Box quest chain can add their chosen red/green/blue trait to some species templates
[list]
[*]Any species that is the "same" as a species which already has the trait
[*]Don't accidentally gene-mod away your last pop with the special trait, or you will lose access - your scientists need examples to study in order to apply the same changes

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Overwrites two core Stellaris files, and thus is not compatible with other mods that make changes to the same files:
[list]
[*][b]common/traits/04_species_traits.txt[/b]
[*][b]common/traits/06_distant_stars_traits.txt[/b]
[/list]
This is due to how the game handles overwrites for traits.  Mods that add new traits or edit other trait files will work just fine.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra." Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Recommended Dependency Mods[/h3]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295]Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits[/url] ensures your leaders have all the appropriate leader traits for their species traits, which is often why players want to create species with Psionic/Cybernetic/Brain Slug Host/Erudite.  Technically optional, but highly recommended so the game adds leader traits like you intuitively expect.

[h3]Recommended Companion Mods[/h3]

[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2498166286]Leader Traits: Scientist AI Assistant Upgrader[/url] will help your scientists upgrade to "Sapient AI Assistants" from "Custom AI Assistants" when you discover the right technology
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2642820468]Leader Traits: Synthetic Leader Traits for Machine Units[/url] will enable Machine Unit leaders to have the same special traits as Synthetic leaders
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553806265]Leader Traits: Enhanced Randomisation[/url] will help your leaders get species-appropriate traits (no more substance abusing robots!) and can randomly get [i]any[/i] of the class-appropriate traits when levelling up
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553818684]Retain Leaders from Integrated Subjects[/url] will let you choose whether you would like to keep leaders from integrated subjects or conquered/infiltrated primitives
[/list]
[h3]Not Included in "Subtle Polish"[/h3]
This mod is intentionally not included in my modpack [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] because of compatibility concerns when overriding traits.  It is otherwise fully compatible.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It replaces two core trait definitions files but does not add gameplay objects.  If you remove it, your game will work normally.  All species will keep their current traits, but you will no longer be able to apply species templates with them to Pops without those traits.
